# Advent of Code

## Warning

Please do not look into the folders if you want to take part by yourself.

## Info

This contains the solutions to the fabulous <https://adventofcode.com> advent calendar.

I use the programming language [rust](<https://rust-lang.org>) for the solutions.

### Disclaimer

The code examples just serve as the "easiest" solution to the problems of the calendar. They are by no means complete or well-tested.
